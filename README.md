Well its me!
Also, yes, that name is kinda weird, but I didn't have much time when i had to think of one so this is what I came up with.

Im mainly working on the Vocabulary reference Book project, but there also is MMMX, for the Wintergatan Marble Machine X (Check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/c/Wintergatan) where we "are" developing a system so the machine cam play automatically, from a Midi source.
