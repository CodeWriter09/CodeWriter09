Also, yes, that name is kinda weird, but I didn't have much time when i had to think of one so this is what I came up with.

Im mainly working on the Vocabulary Reference Book project (NQN), but there also is MMMX, for the Wintergatan Marble Machine X (Check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/c/Wintergatan) where we (The cool people on the Wintergatan Discord Server: https://discord.gg/wintergatan) "are" developing a system so the machine cam play automatically, from a Midi source.
