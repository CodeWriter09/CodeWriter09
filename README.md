Well its me!

Also, yes, that name is kinda weird, but I didn't have much time when creating this account, so this is what I came up with.

Im mainly working on the Vocabulary Reference Book project (NQN) here, the MMMX Project for the Wintergatan Marble Machine X (Check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/c/Wintergatan) where we (The cool people on the Wintergatan Discord Server: https://discord.gg/wintergatan) were "developing" a system so the machine cam play automatically, from a Midi source is kinda dead tho, because the MMX is discontinued...
